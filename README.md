# Auto-complete Challenge
If you're reading this: HEY THERE! üëã

## What would be the best way to implement an auto-complete feature for a search engine? 
As an example, we have a hardcoded list of 25 words that are saved in memory.
When a user types a prefix, the program returns 4 words that start with that prefix in alphabetical order.

### Which data structure to use? 
That would be the first question I asked myself in the process.
As we're only managing 25 words that are stored in memory, we could use a simple ArrayList.
However, I decided on a TreeSet (already sorted) - with a subset method to get the words that start with the prefix.

#### [OPTIONAL SCENARIOS]

1. If we were dealing with a larger dataset, I would consider using a **trie data structure**.
Tries are efficient for storing and searching for strings, because it is not a binary tree - the nature of the search is based on the prefix length and not the amount of data.
This also allows an efficient storage of common prefixes.

2. If we were dealing with the same 25-word list - I would consider using an ArrayList or HashMap.
The reason being is that the prefix search is very efficient with the TreeSet due to its sorted nature - however with a list and the method contains() we could manage this scenario easily.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up, compile, and run the project.
This project is meant to be built and run with command line tools.

### üõ† Prerequisites

Java 21 - Ensure Java 21 is installed as this project relies on features available in this version.

macOS
1. Install Homebrew if you haven‚Äôt already.
2. Install Maven using Homebrew (Xcode Command Line Tools are required):

   brew install maven

Linux
1. Update your package manager:
   sudo apt update # For Debian/Ubuntu-based distros sudo dnf update # For Fedora-based distros

2. Install Maven:
   sudo apt install maven # Debian/Ubuntu sudo dnf install maven # Fedora


Windows
1. Download Maven from the official website.
2. Follow the installation instructions to set up Maven on your system.
3. Add the Maven bin directory to your system PATH.
4. Restart your terminal or command prompt.

### üîß Project Setup

Clone the repository (or download it) and navigate to the project directory.

Compile the project by running:
mvn clean install

This will compile all necessary files and prepare the project for execution.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project
Once compiled, navigate to the target directory.
Run the project using the following command:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="App"    

The program will prompt you to enter a prefix for generating auto-complete suggestions if no argument is provided.
You can always provide a prefix as an argument:

mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="App" -Dexec.args="Pr"

### üß™ Running Tests

To ensure everything is working as expected, execute the test suite by running:
mvn test
